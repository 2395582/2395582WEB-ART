      The revision videos were quite comprehensive, and hopefully an important
      addition to my arsenal that I can revisit anytime the need arises. Net/web
      art is confusing. Not just the concept, but the artworks themselves are
      difficult to comprehend. (For example, http://indirect.flights/ has
      absolutely nothing to do with airplanes!) This confusion obviously lead to
      some pressing questions (pressing because I am expected not only to know
      what web art is, but to make one), questions I thought about for some
      time. What is art? Is a light switch art? This is just the kind of
      statements I’ve come to expect from lectures in this degree, and it
      remains statements that annoy me to no end. Annoy me, in that now I have
      to sit and think about whether or not a switch if art when I turn off the
      light in my room. It’s an annoying question because it, ultimately has two
      answers (yes and no) and both these answers are correct. Or at least
      legit. What it all boils down to is; things can be viewed through
      different lenses, and thus offer different solutions to one problem.
      (That’s pronounced con-vol-uted) Now, this method of viewing things
      doesn’t leave as much freedom as one may expect. Web art is a very
      specific type of art, and its specifications restrict the answer to the
      question; what is web art? Is a picture of Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa found on
      the internet ‘web art’? No, because it doesn’t conform to the
      specificities of web art. In order for something to be classified as WA
      (web art, I’m a lazy typist, sue me) it needs to rely on the web to create
      the art. I think. (?) Another question is what constitutes “good” WA? All
      the examples I’d seen scorned description, never mind critique. I couldn’t
      box them into my usual categories of High Brow (The Godfather, Francis
      Ford Coppola), Low Brow (What’s New Pussycat?, Clive Donner), Good (Shrek
      2), Bad (Shrek 3), or any other category for that matter. The WA I perused
      merely existed. Open to interpretation maybe? Pretentious garbage? Plain
      weird?
